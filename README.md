# 🛍 Ecommerce Customers - Data Analysis and Prediction Project

## Project Goal
This Jupyter Notebook project involves data analysis and machine learning based on ecommerce customer data. The goal is to identify the factors influencing customers' online and offline purchasing behaviors and to build a predictive model.

## 📁 Files
**Ecommerce Customers.ipynb** – The main notebook which includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Correlation analysis
- Building a linear regression model
- Model evaluation

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓  
- NumPy & Pandas – data processing  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib – visualization  
- Scikit-learn – modeling and evaluation  

## 📈 Results
Within this project, a linear regression model was built to predict customer spending on the website based on the following factors:  
- Time on Website  
- Time on App  
- Yearly Income  
- Average Session Length  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Open the file `Ecommerce Customers.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells sequentially  
4. Review the data analysis, visualizations, and prediction results  

## 📌 Note
This project is a personal demonstration of data analysis and predictive skills. It is based on synthetic or anonymized data and is not intended for commercial use.
